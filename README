XMAHJONGG 3.7
=============

MAKING XMAHJONGG
----------------
   You need an ANSI C++ compiler, such as g++, but not C++ libraries.

   Just type `./configure', then `make'. `make install' will build and
install xmahjongg, its shared data, and its manual page. `./configure'
accepts the usual options. See `INSTALL' for more details.

   (More details: Give `configure' a `--prefix' option to install xmahjongg
somewhere other than `/usr/local'. You can also give `configure' the
`--bindir', `--mandir', and `--datadir' options for more more precise
control. N.B.: `make install' will place all the shared data files in a
subdirectory named `$(datadir)/xmahjongg'.)

   If you want to test xmahjongg after compiling it, you'll run into
trouble since the shared data have not been installed yet. To fix this,
supply the `-B' option:

	% make
	% ./xmahjongg -B ./share --tileset small

ABOUT XMAHJONGG
---------------
   Xmahjongg is a simple solitaire game. The object is to remove all 144
Mah Jongg tiles from the playing area by matching them two at a time.

   Xmahjongg 2.0 was released in 1990 by Jeff S. Young <jsy@cray.com>. This
version has been completely rewritten by Eddie Kohler <eddietwo@mit.edu>.

   New features in 3.0:
   * Pretty, round-edged, and colorful Mah Jongg tiles.
   * Multiple tile sets.
   * Undo.
   * Hints let you quickly locate possible matches.
   * Solvable boards by default.
   * A clean button for automatically removing certain kinds of tiles.
   * Aesthetics.
   * A count of matches remaining.
   * No fiddling with the X font path.

   Features 2.0 has that are not yet available in 3.0:
   * Tournament mode.
   * Visible board numbers.
   * A "Same" button. (You can click Undo a lot to get the same effect.)
   * Layout configuration mode.

   Please see the man page, `xmahjongg.6', for information on how to play
the game.

   Xmahjongg comes with NO WARRANTY, express or implied, including, but not
limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
particular purpose.
