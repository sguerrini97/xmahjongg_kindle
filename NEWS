Xmahjongg NEWS

Version 3.7   8.Mar.2005

* Man page bug fixes from Debian via Dave Swegen.

* Source code reorganization.


Version 3.6.1   13.Sep.2002

* Compilation fixes for newer GCCs; problems reported by Rene Blokland.


Version 3.6   21.Aug.2001

* Added `rat', `ox', `tiger', `hare', `dragon', `snake', `horse', `ram',
  `monkey', `rooster', `dog', and `boar' layouts -- the whole Chinese
  zodiac! -- contributed by Todd Michel McComb <mccomb@medieval.org>.


Version 3.5   30.Jun.2001

* Added native support for KDE Mahjongg (kmahjongg) tilesets and layouts.
  (The tilesets must be converted to GIF format; kmahjongg uses BMP.)
  Brought to my attention by Jim Broderick <broderick@linuxfreemail.com>.

* Another compilation fix reported by Rene Blokland <reneb@cistron.nl>.

* Fixed bug: xmahjongg would ignore some button release events.


Version 3.4   17.May.2001

* Compilation fix for newer gccs.


Version 3.3   3.Apr.2000

* Game play change: If a tile is selected already and you click a tile that
  doesn't match, the selection is transferred to that new tile. (It used to
  just beep at you.)

* Bug fix in permstr.cc: now xmahjongg can be compiled with recent versions
  of gcc. The error was a strange use of va_arg(). Reported by C. M.
  Connelly <c@eskimo.com>.


Version 3.2   5.Jan.2000

* Added two new tilesets: `dorothys', a colored version by Dorothy Robinson
  <mokuren@teleport.com> (the old `dorothys' has been renamed to
  `dorwhite'), and `real', scanned images of some real Mah Jongg tiles
  provided by Mark Sanctuary <sanctuary@jps.net>.

* Added new tileset format. Check `share/tiles/real.gif' to see what it
  looks like.


Version 3.1   30.Dec.1999

* Some small changes to hopefully fix a mystery bug: Some people report
  that xmahjongg appears with no tiles visible. I can't replicate this.


Version 3.0   19.Dec.1999

* Finally completed number font!

* Better support for very thick tilesets and tilesets with lower-right
  direction shadows.

* The `thick' tileset is now the default.

* Speed improvements on highlighting and unhighlighting tiles.

* The match count no longer bleeds into the layout area when there are a
  lot of matches.

* Can read Kyodai Mahjongg layout files. (See http://www.kyodai.com/)


Version 3.0b11   17.Dec.1999

* Added `dorothys' tileset, thanks to Dorothy Robinson
  <mokuren@teleport.com>, artist of the original xmahjongg tiles. Also
  added support for tilesets that don't have lower-left direction shadows.


Version 3.0b10   12.Jan.1999

* Fixed buffer overrun bug: xmahjongg wouldn't load anything but the
  default layout.


Version 3.0b9   28.Dec.1998

* The xmahjongg package now uses automake.

* Use the failing-malloc library to avoid problems with some systems' bad
  realloc() definitions.

* Improved error messages on bad files.


Version 3.0b8   5.Nov.1998

* Added support for Gnome Mahjongg-style tilesets. (Well, almost: while
  Gnome Mahjongg reads XPMs -- and probably every other format, using imlib
  -- xmahjongg can still only read GIFs.)

* Added two tilesets from Gnome Mahjongg: `gnome' and `gnome2'. These
  tilesets were apparently created by Jonathan Buzzard and Max Watson.

* Shrank the border around the layout to waste less screen space. The default
  tileset with default layout will now fit on a 1024x768 screen.

* Renamed the `--board' option to `--layout'. Moved `share/boards' to 
  `share/layouts'. Renamed the `tall' tileset to `thick'.


Version 3.0b7   26.Sep.1998

* `--help' now prints to stdout, following the GNU Coding Standards.

* Made `--solvable-boards' the default.

* Makefiles: Added `make uninstall' target, enabled `./configure's
  program name transformations, made VPATH builds possible.


Version 3.0b6   17.Sep.1998

* More configuration changes so it'll work with egcs or gcc-2.7.2.1.


Version 3.0b5   16.Sep.1998

* Made it compilable with egcs.


Version 3.0b4   12.Sep.1998

* Fixed several display and clipping bugs.

* Added `--list' and `--background'.

* Initial display and new-game display are cleaner.

* Cleaned up Panel and Board by removing unused or duplicate members and
  functionality.


Version 3.0b3   10.Sep.1998

* Who the hell knows.


Version 3.0b2   7.Sep.1998

* Big release after the summer. Traversal, solutions, bug fixes, cleaned-up
  code, a first go at a tile count, etc., etc.


Version 3.0a1   1997

* First release.
