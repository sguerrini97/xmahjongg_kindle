- From Adam Sulmicki <adam@cfar.umd.edu>: Here's a feature-wish. To have an
option for "show removed tiles" just like it is in the latest KDE version
of kmahjongg (not sure if is released as I have used cvs version).
Basically a 4x9 board at a side which stacks the blocks which have been
removed (up to 4 high).
